Basic Calculator Using Java Swing----->

This project is a simple calculator application built using Java Swing for a graphical user interface. The calculator performs four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features---->

Addition: Calculate the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction: Calculate the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Calculate the product of two numbers.
Division: Calculate the quotient of two numbers (includes error handling for division by zero).
How It Works

The application consists of a GUI with the following components:

Labels: Indicate the purpose of each text field (e.g., "First Number", "Second Number", "Result").
Text Fields: Allow the user to input two numbers for the calculation.
Buttons: Four buttons to perform different arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Result Field: Displays the output of the calculation.


Exception Handling----->

The program uses a try-catch block to handle NumberFormatException in case the user inputs non-numeric values.
Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.
